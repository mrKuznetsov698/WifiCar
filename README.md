# Wifi car on WEMOS D1 R1 Mini

This project use [platformio](https://platformio.org/) and was written in [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I use:
1. [DFRobot turtle](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-65.html)
2. [Two-channel H-bridge](https://amperka.ru/product/troyka-h-bridge-dual) <-- This is important, because there are many motor drivers types and if you use another one, you probably should change code.

[Here](https://amperka.ru/product/troyka-h-bridge-dual#docs) docs for this motor driver (WARNING: Russian language)

**P.S.** Maybe I'll add few images of my robot later.
