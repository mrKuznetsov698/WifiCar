# Wifi car on WEMOS D1 R1 Mini

I use:
1. [DFRobot turtle](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-65.html)
2. [Two-channel H-bridge](https://amperka.ru/product/troyka-h-bridge-dual) <-- This is important, because there are many motor drivers types and if you use another one, you probably should change code.

[Here](https://amperka.ru/product/troyka-h-bridge-dual#docs) docs for this motor driver (WARNING: Russian language)
